# Comments to Evaluators
This is the Assignment project to create a library to calculate a string fromula and return a result integer. In this project, I
created a delegate as a lookup method which can convert an unknow variable into a integer. Then I crerated Evaluate Method to pr-
ocess the formula string. Then I used foreach loop and if statement to calculated it. I created the mulitiply-divide and add-minus
helper method to simplify the code. The core method in this libaray is evaluate. Evaluate passes string of formula and a variable 
look up method in. Then it will divide in to different tokens to calculated it. Then return a method, like pass "5+(9-4/2)*3" will
get 26.
