# Comments to Evaluators
This is the Spreadsheet project. It has a spreadsheet file which is the child class of abstract spreadsheet 
and has correct implementaion. I use the buildin helper method in the Abstract Spreadsheet class. Inside the 
spreadsheet file, I create a simple cell class to store the cell's name and cell's value - can be string, double
or formula. It uses a dependency graph and a dictionary as the private values in the class. The dependency will 
be stored in the dependency graph. And dictionary will store the whole cells with string as name, value as cell.
